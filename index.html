              About Us
            </h2>
            <p>
              Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
              transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
              obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
              of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at
              TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how
              officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
              must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
              allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes
              accountability and provides information for citizens about what
              their Government is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
              engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves
              the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
              society, and public officials benefit from having access to that
              dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become
              actively engaged in American government.
            </p>
            <p>
              TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
              readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
              information of greatest use to the public.
            </p>

                  Background History of Government Transparency
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
                  scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least
                  to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
                  attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of
                  their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
                  instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with
                  Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
                  Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
                  part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
                  approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
                  related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                  public sphere.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America
                  (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined
                  provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
                  freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the
                  nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row
                  back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of
                  eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton
                  prominent among the latter.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of
                  contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the
                  passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
                  countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information
                  legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
                  eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of
                  openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                  Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                  legislation in 1999).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
                  in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent
                  laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
